## Short description

### What's the problem?

In 2016, The Straits Times reported that as many as 2 in 3 young people have not started investing with the lack of financial knowledge being cited as one of the key reasons. As financial information is becoming increasingly accessible and more diverse in nature, it is important that youths have the access to the right information to help facilitate an apt investment plan for retirement.	
<br><br>
The task is to design a solution on a platform of your choice, mobile or web, that empowers youths to make smart decisions with their finances by recommending ways and means to make their money work for them.
<br><br>
The solution should target youths with emphasis in helping them make sense of the labyrinth of financial information available out there and how this information can guide them in making smart decisions. 

### How can our web application help?

The Millionnials is a web application designed for young people to gain financial knowledge through financial planning, scenario-based learning and trading simulation using real time market information. It enables our users to learn in three ways: watch your money, safeguard your money and grow your money.

### Our Mission

Make Dreams Happen for Millennials.
